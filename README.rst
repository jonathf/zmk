My personal ZMK configuration
=============================

ZMK allow you to configure the keyboard layout of your keyboard.
This is mine.

This configuration contains both the map for my `Tern BLE
<https://gitlab.com/gleb_sexy/tern-ble>`_ (a `Hummingbird style
<https://github.com/jcmkk3/awesome-hummingbirds>`_ keyboard).

I utilize `Urob helpers <https://github.com/urob/zmk-helpers>`_, and because
I have two board types, abstract over layout.
